# Pentathlon

### Status : Upsolved
> Almost got it, just missing the second part.

## Category

## Description
I forgot the detail but in this challange you must solve 5 challenge from the file given. Here is the file [chall1.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJfTWcS9Bj2R9b6O7k9x1N1C26BKk8ZA/view?usp=drive_link)

## Solution
As mentioned in the challenge, there were 5 steps to complete.

1. **Step 1**

   ![chall1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63ddeefc-2cc7-4278-aaa4-336d66775a38)
   
   The image mentioned `binwalk`, so I checked it with `binwalk` and extracted the contents. That gave me a file called `20.png`:
   
   ![20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/646c4573-036c-4f84-ace0-7784d39fe98a)
   
   I assumed I had to keep running `binwalk` until the hidden file containing the flag was revealed. To make it easier, I wrote a small script:
   ```python
   import subprocess

   path = ""

    for i in range(20, 0, -1):
      index = ""
      if i < 10:
        index = f"0{i}"
      else:
        index = f"{i}"
    
      target_file = path + f"{index}.png"

      print(target_file)

      subprocess.run(['binwalk', '-e', target_file])

      next_path = f"_{index}.png.extracted/"
      path = path + next_path 
   ```

   After running this recursively, I found the first part of the flag:

2. **Step 2**

   The last `binwalk` extraction also gave me `chall2.jpg`:

   ![chall2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07445bf4-9efc-4a9b-8852-cc40f65a31d9)

   The text suggested that the image was cropped. From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) , I learned that the height value of a `JPEG` is stored as a hex value. I also found a more detailed explanation [here](https://cyberhacktics.com/hiding-information-by-changing-an-images-height/).

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2977df10-5f90-470d-b1d6-ed420abbea5b)

   By modifying the height value in a hex editor and increasing it, the hidden content was revealed:

   part 2 : cr0is_3n_m0i

3. **Step 3**

   From the previous extraction, I suspected the next clue was hidden in the fileâ€™s `metadata`. Using `exiftool`, I found a Google Drive link:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0fa22d5-e28e-4069-ba51-3ca3e9b0fda5)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4b72d3d-09ae-492b-b0c8-1d02c5763c09)

   The link pointed to a password-protected zip file. I cracked it using `fcrackzip` with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist:

4. **Step 4**

   This step provided `chall4.png` and a script `script.py`. The script was clearly used to encode a secret message into `chall4.png`:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image

   message = open("secret.txt", "r").read()
   msg = [ord(m) for m in message]

   image = Image.open("chall4_original.png")
   pixels = image.load()

   for i in range(len(msg)):
       r, g, b = pixels[i*3,0]
       pixels[i*3,0] = msg[i]^g, g^b, b

   image.save("chall4.png")
   ```
   The encoding worked by converting each character into its ASCII value, XORing it with the `g` component of a pixel, and saving the result in the `r` component. The `g` component was also XORed with the `b` component. To recover the original message, I simply reversed the process:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image

   image = Image.open('chall4.png')
   pixels = image.load()

   message = ""

   for i in range(120):
       r, g, b = pixels[i*3,0]
       g = g^b
       message += chr(r^g)

   print(message)
   ```

5. **Step 5**

   This step included a hint:

   ![chall5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdf53c09-1827-41e2-8029-c770c1131062)

   It looked like I had to repair `finish.png`. I started by checking it with `pngcheck`:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4514dc4-f882-4e87-b56f-b113b970396b)

   The output showed errors in `PNG` chunks and even suggested the correct values. Using a `hex editor`, I manually fixed the errors one by one until the file was restored:

   ![finish](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/399b3fd3-d6b9-4728-b9f3-16cda5632f54)
