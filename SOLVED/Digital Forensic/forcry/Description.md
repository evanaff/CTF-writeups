## Description
I found a PNG file that seems to be broken and I suspect someone tried to encrypt it badly. From a quick look, it seems like the file wasn't fully encrypted and only parts of the data were affected. Interestingly, the pattern of encryption looks suspiciously repetitive and I believe the encryption key and the pattern are the same. The data might have been shifted multiple times but not randomly. Can you figure out the encryption flow and help me restore the original image?

P.S : source code not provided
